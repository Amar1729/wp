# wp

Formalized from some scripts on [my dotfiles](https://github.com/amar1729/dotfiles), this script manages pywal, wallpapers, and other ricing stuff:
- handles different wallpapers on different desktops/monitors
- handles reloading colors from current or other space
- can update transparency (iterm2)
- can pixelate the terminal based on the current wallpaper (iterm2)

This script facilitates something like an Ubersicht bar that can be different colors on different spaces, or simple terminal windows whose colors match the background.

### Installation

This script lives in my tap, so you can install it easily:

```bash
brew install --HEAD amar1729/formulae/wp
```
